<h2>Java Script</h2>
<p>
JavaScript is an object-based script programming language. 
This language is commonly used within web browsers and has the 
ability to access built-in objects in other applications. It is
 .js programming, such as runtime environments such as Node. 
 JavaScript was originally developed by Brendan Eich of Netscape 
 Communications Corporation, first named Mocha and later LiveScript,
  and eventually JavaScript. JavaScript has similar syntax to That of
   Sun Microsystems, but in fact both languages are based on the basic
    syntax of the C language, and Java and JavaScript have no direct 
    relevance. Other than name and syntax, there are more similarities 
    to self or scheme than Java.</p></ul></body></html>
